# Text Mining Project  
Welcome to my Text Mining Project! This repository contains code and resources for analyzing large-scale text data to extract relevant expressions, explicit keywords, and implicit keywords. The goal of this project is to explore and extract key insights from thousands of textual documents using Python. The project leverages various text mining techniques to preprocess and clean the text data, identify and extract relevant expressions and patterns, and detect and extract explicit and implicit keywords.

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed: Python 3.7+ and the required Python libraries listed in requirements.txt.  
To get started, clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`, navigate into the project directory using cd your-repo-name and infally install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The project is structured as follows: The `data/` directory contains the dataset(s) used for analysis; `src/` contains the core codebase for text preprocessing, extraction, and analysis; and `results/` stores results, extracted expressions, and keywords.

To run the project, execute the scripts in the `src/` folder for different stages of analysis. First, run `python src/preprocessing.py` to clean and prepare the data. Then, execute `python src/extraction.py` to perform expression extraction. Finally, run `python src/keyword_analysis.py` to carry out keyword analysis. The results will be saved in the `results/` folder, including extracted expressions, keywords, and any generated reports or visualizations.

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. For major changes, open an issue to discuss what you would like to change. This project is licensed under the MIT License, and you can find the details in the `LICENSE` file.
